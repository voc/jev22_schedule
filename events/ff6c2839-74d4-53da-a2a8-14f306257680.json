  "description": "Stencils are a great way to cover things (walls, pavements, cars, whatever) in paint. I couldn't find a good beginner tutorial for making them, and thus this talk was born. I assume that you:\r\n\r\n- know nothing about stencils\r\n- are not artsy\r\n- have a bare minimum of manual skills.\r\n\r\n(just like me a year ago)\r\n\r\nAll you need is a computer, and access to a laser/vinyl cutter (don't bring yours to the workshop, we'll provide one).",
