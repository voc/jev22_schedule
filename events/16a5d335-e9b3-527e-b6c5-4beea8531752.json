  "description": "Berlin Hack and Tell is a monthly(ish) meetup where eight entities can show their hacks at c-base space station every(ish) last Tuesday of the month.\r\nThis time the last Tuesday of the month is in parallel to HIP as a special edition.\r\nYou have five minutes followed by up to five minutes of interaction with the audience. \r\nShow us code or other cool stuff, not slides or a sales pitch! Show off a silly/hobby project that you can\u2019t present elsewhere. Do some software archaeology and dig in ancient code. Show some code that makes your life a little better. As long as it is interesting and/or fun and not pitch-y you are welcome to present kind of anything that can be considered hack in a wider scope you are invited to show it.\r\nThink of it like \u201cstand up hacking\u201d. \r\nCheck out the past projects here: \r\nhttps://berlinhackandtell.rocks",
