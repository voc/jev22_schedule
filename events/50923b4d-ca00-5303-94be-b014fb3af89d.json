  "description": "First half will be an overview of task-and organisation systems, and the underlying concept how to use it. It is not a hands-on handholding session, but rather explaining the concept, so that you can check and integrate the systems that fit best to your mind & workflows.\r\n\r\nSecond half will then be a collection of some nice tricks and tools (PKM, Inbox-zero, Logseq, Obsidian, Emacs (org-mode),..) \r\n\r\nThird is the most important: FAQ-round for your concerns and issues regarding time- and organisation-systems.\r\nBest way to learn and teach is by communicating, so lets talk!",
