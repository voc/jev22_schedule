  "abstract": "The talk aims to give an insight into the thought process when reverse engineering and exploiting vulnerabilties in general and specifically in .Net.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to not only show the final exploit, but also the dead ends and rabbit holes.",
  "description": "This talk goes step by step from a false positive flagged by automated tools to a full local privilege escalation in the Lenovo Vantage service.\r\nExperience the twists, turns and despair of security research until the sweet release of a SYSTEM shell.\r\n\r\nThe talk focusses mainly on the thought process and showing both successes and failures.\r\nThe goal is to try and make the subject approachable and less intimidating, even if the final exploit chain is relatively complicated involving a path traversal, TOCTOU and NTFS shenanigans.",
