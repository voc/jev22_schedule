  "abstract": "Most open-source projects have limit lifetime: at some point in time development stops and the project becomes unmaintained. A lot of projects often do not even reach the stage, where they are used by a critical mass of users.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will go through the steps of continuing an open-source project using my lessons learned from forking Google's MyTracks and crafting it into OpenTracks.",
  "description": "What makes an open-source project successful? How does a hands-on lifecycle of an open-source project look like? How can we ensure that an open-source project stays meaningful over several years? \r\n\r\nIn 2016, Google decided to sun set MyTracks, which was a very successful Android application for GPS tracking. Back in 2019, I forked Google's MyTracks and re-branded as OpenTracks.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present the hands-on lessons I learned in the subsequent 3 years of ongoing development.",
