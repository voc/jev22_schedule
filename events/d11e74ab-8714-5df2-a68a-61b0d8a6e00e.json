  "description": "On a boring evening, I thought of playing around with automated scanning using long bash one-liners. The next morning, a one-liner consisting of 17 pipes was born which found a few hundred valid subdomains prone to subdomain takeover. This wasn't really complicated, but by automating such a process, I had the chance to dive deeper into the whole topic and found quite a weird ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis talk is there to give you the whole context: from the basic \"what is subdomain takeover?\" to further \"well how can it be found?\" until the essential \"well how to we solve this once and for all?\".",
