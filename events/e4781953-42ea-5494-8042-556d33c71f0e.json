  "description": "Alligator Gozaimasu is a band of many voices and noises. The international music collective counts more than 60 members. Some of them are based in Munich or live nearby, others are spread all over the globe.\r\nDuring the Open Music Video Recording participants are heartily invited to dive into the collective's colourful universe. Based on \"Qoi Que Tu Dis\", one of Alligator Gozaimasu's experimental tracks, a collaborative music video will be recorded. The idea is to question binary frameworks and try other perspectives together. Sound artist and fashion designer Stephanie M\u00fcller aka Rag*Treasure offers a selection of handmade costumes and props. Participants can freely choose if they'd like to slip into one of the costumes and masks. Queerfeminist filmmaker and artist Klaus Erika Dietl provides DIY camera and light equipment. Minimum is maximum Rock'n'Roll: we'll focus on tiny image details and on small gestures. Let's do it together.",
