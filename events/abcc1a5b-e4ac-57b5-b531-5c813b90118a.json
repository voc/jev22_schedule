  "description": "This workshop is for '''''total newbies''''' to learn to solder by making their own ArduTouch music synthesizer.<br>\r\n\r\nWe will also learn how to generate sound, music, and noise with computer chips.\r\n\r\n[https://cornfieldelectronics.com/cfe/projects.php#ardutouch ArduTouch] is an [https://github.com/maltman23/ArduTouch open source] Arduino-compatible music synthesizer kit with a built-in touch keyboard, and with built-in speaker/amplifier.<br>\r\n\r\nThe ArduTouch comes pre-programmed with a way cool synthesizer.  And I will show you how to re-program it with other way cool (and totally different) synthesizers.<br>\r\n\r\nParticipants will all learn to solder and make an ArduTouch music synthesizer from a kit.  I guarantee it will work when you're done!<br>\r\n\r\nThe ArduTouch comes pre-programmed with a really nice music synthesizer (a 4-voice sawtooth waveform generator) -- called \"Thick\", that makes super phat sounds.<br>\r\nAn ArduTouch Arduino library is available for programming in more super nice synthesizers, with lots and lots of features. The library also comes with many way cool example synthesizer sketches that also serve as a tutorial for making your own ArduTouch synthesizers (which are Arduino sketches).<br>\r\n\r\nArduTouch currently has 9 totally different synthesizers available! Synth sounds include way beautiful to metal to noise to drones to psychedelic, and also a drum/bass machine sequencer.\r\n\r\nFor those who want to learn more, the documentation teaches the basics of Digital Signal Processing for audio generation.<br>\r\n\r\nThis workshop is for '''''total newbies'''''!",

      "biography": "Mitch Altman is an international hacker and inventor, best known for inventing TV-B-Gone remote controls, a keychain that turns off TVs in public places.  He has been creating music and music synthesizers since he was a teenager, was co-founder of 3ware, a successful Silicon Valley startup in the late 1990s, and did pioneering work in Virtual Reality in the mid-1980s. He has contributed to 2600, MAKE, and other magazines, and wrote a chapter for \u201cMaker Pro\u201d, a book about making a living from projects one loves.  Mitch enjoys his frequent hacker/artist-in-residencies, where he shares, learns, and continues to cross-pollinate.  For the last several years Mitch has been giving performances, talks, leading workshops around the world, inspiring people, sharing how to make cool things with electronics, and teaching everyone to solder.  He promotes hackerspaces and open source hardware, and mentors others wherever he goes. He is a co-founder of Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco, and is President and CEO of Cornfield Electronics.\r\n\r\n    Wikipedia page:\r\n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman\r\n\r\n    TEDxBrussels talk: \"The Hackerspace Movement\":\r\n    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkiX7R1-kaY",
