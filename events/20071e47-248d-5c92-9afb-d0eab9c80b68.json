Come to this talk/workshop and we will set you up. You will need a badge (naturally), a laptop with (ideally) linux on it, and a USB cable to connect the laptop and the badge.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is also an opportunity to exchange ideas and other wisdom around this device. Whether you know all or nothing -- come as you are, and show us your amazing hacks and ideas on the badge. Let's get the energy flowing in preparation for the summer camp.",
