  "description": "C-KiNO #95 will be an updated version of our episode presented at Bits Und Baume at TU Berlin in Oktober 2022.  For Chaos in Potsdam we would like to provide a brief report back on our experiences at BnB conferences ( both 2018 and 22 ) along with our ongoing work related to the controversial \"Anthropocene\" and \"Technosphere\" framings of our ecological and social crises. We share our \"XLterrestrials\" ( i.e. alien, sci-fi and indigenous-inclusive ) analysis and critical perspectives. And we encourage questions, discussion and debate.",
