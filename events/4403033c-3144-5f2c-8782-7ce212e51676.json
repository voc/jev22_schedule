  "description": "Masking Threshold is a 2021 English-language Austrian horror film directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner, and produced by art group monochrom.\r\n\r\nA skeptic IT worker tries to cure his harrowing hearing impairment by conducting a series of experiments in his makeshift home lab.\r\n\r\nThe film combines the style of a chamber play, a scientific procedural and the aesthetic of unboxing or DIY YouTube videos, with body horror elements and techniques known from experimental film. Grenzfurthner sees the film in the tradition of extreme cinema, but presents elements of psychological horror. \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masking_Threshold_(film)\r\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8ciPdXC6BQ&",
