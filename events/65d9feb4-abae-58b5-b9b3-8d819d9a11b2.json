  "description": "\u201cNever mind the gig work\u2026 here\u2019s the Coffebots!\u201d\u00a0is a marionette puppet extravaganza full of robots, coffee, and algorithmic capitalism. A punk rock space opera!  It is the reconstruction of the filmed version of a puppet play that was never performed. The completion of a work long in the making, and it turned out to be a movie, in the end.\r\n\r\nFollow our brave little coffeebots and their struggle against the system. Fly with us to the end of the universe to fight the big bad endboss.\r\n\r\nOur play will use the language of the Internet: Easy English with heavy accents and lots of technobabble.\r\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvfJ3_a-lKA",
