  "description": "Impulsvortrag: Supporting Resilience with Mindfulness - Connecting with body as a resource \r\n\r\n\r\nMany activists are highly engaged and identified with their work and often carry their worry and thoughts with them through every day life, way beyond their actual work. How can we support activism by learning how stress impacts our systems? How can we generate spaces that are safe and nourishing? \r\nMindfulness is a tool that can be used way further then as personal relaxation method but actually supports resilient movements of resistance, nourish communities with establishing habits of pausing and caring and learning to be with what is. MBSR is a method that was developed in working with pain patients and takes a close look at the phenomenon of stress as well as physiogical and emotional pain. \r\n\r\n\r\nPresentation - What is stress?\r\nHow does stress impact our physical and emotional health?\r\nHow does mindfulness impact our stress reactions.\r\nHow could I start to practice?",
